# What is a webhook

A webhook is an HTTPS request sent from FareHarbor to a server of your
choice as a result of an event.

FareHarbor can send webhooks when bookings are created, updated,
rebooked, or cancelled, when a contact changes, when a checkin occurs,
when items are updated,
etc.

For ideas about how to use webhooks in concert with the External API,
see [/external-api/faqs-and-best-practices.md](/webhooks/faqs-and-best-practices.md).

# Configuring webhooks

You can provide two webhook URLs to FareHarbor: one for production
webhooks and one for test webhooks.

Contact <support@fareharbor.com> to configure these.

(Note: The server for the production webhook URL must have a valid SSL
certificate. If it doesn't have one, then the webhook will not be
delivered. It is up to you to ensure that your SSL certificates get
renewed as needed.)

(Note: Companies in demo mode do not trigger webhooks.)

Your server should respond to the webhook with an HTTP success
response code. If FareHarbor receives an HTTP error response or no
response at all, then the webhook will be retried some number of
times, with a significant pause between attempts. If FareHarbor detects
too many failures (non-200 statuses) within a short period of time, we
may deactivate the webhook and contact you.

## Booking notifications

When a booking-related event occurs, FareHarbor sends a `POST` request to
the webhook URL that you have provided.

Depending on how your webhooks are configured, these `POST` requests will be sent for:

* all changes to bookings (including creations, modifications, and cancellations);
* creations only; or
* cancellations only.

The body of this request contains an up-to-date JSON representation of
the booking.

There are four booking data types that can be sent to a webhook: A full set of data
contained in the booking fields, as well as optimized versions of each type to reduce
the amount of fields, thereby decreasing the amount of data you need to store and
process (filter).

* **Bookings only** (default setting). The data returned in this data type includes:
*Contact Name*, *Phone*, *Email*, *Activity*, *Availability*, *Customer Types*,
*Custom Fields*, *Subtotal*, *Tax*, *Total* and *Amount paid* from a booking. Note
that payment and refund information is not included with this data type.
* **Bookings only (Optimized)**: This data type returns a smaller group of fields
as compared to **Bookings only**, in order to improve performance and give you only
the data that is of most importance to you. Note that these fields also **do not**
include payment or refund information.
The following data fields are returned using this data type: *Item*, *Company*,
*Contact*, *Availability*, *Customers*, *Custom field values*, *Effective cancellation
policy*, *Invoice*, *Receipt*, *Amount paid*, *Agent*, *Desk*, *Status* and *Rebooked*.
* **Bookings + payments**: If you want to send payment and refund data, in addition
to what is sent with Bookings only, select this type for all bookings fields and
including payment information.
* **Bookings + payments (Optimized)**: Use this data type when you want to receive
a subset of bookings data, as compared to the full **Bookings + payments** output.
The data returned for the optimized call will also include payment and refund
information. Sending data using an optimized connection can enhance server performance
during the API call by filtering out only the most frequently used fields. This will
also allow you to more effectively manage only the data that is of interest.

Some of the fields are described here: [/external-api/endpoints.md](/external-api/endpoints/endpoints.md) and
here: [/external-api/data-types.md#booking](/external-api/endpoints/data-types.md#booking).

Depending how your webhook is configured and what fields you are
allowed to view, there may also be a `payments` property:

    {
      "booking": {
        "pk": 456,
        "payments": [
          {
            "amount_paid": 1939,
            "amount_paid_display": "19.39",
            "created_at": "2020-07-23T14:43:30-1000",
            "currency": "usd",
            "initial_amount_paid": 2154,
            "initial_amount_paid_display": "21.54",
            "pk": 6234,
            "refunds": [
              {
                "amount_refunded": 215,
                "amount_refunded_display": "2.15",
                "created_at": "2020-07-23T14:43:41-1000",
                "is_cancelled": false,
                "pk": 1123
              }
            ],
            "status": "succeeded",
            "type": "affiliate",
            "in_store_payment_type": {
               "pk": 137,
               "name": "Cash"
            }
          }
        ],
        ...
      }
    }

When the payment is `type: "in-store"`, the `in_store_payment_type` in
the response has the pk and name of the in-store payment type.

When the payment is `type: "affiliate"` and the payment is an
affiliate in-store payment, the `in_store_payment_type` in the
response has the pk of the in-store payment type and may have the name
as well.

When the payment is not an in-store payment, the
`in_store_payment_type` in the response is `null`.

## Item notifications

When an item-related event occurs, FareHarbor sends a `POST` request to
the webhook URL that you have provided.

The body of this request contains a JSON representation of
some of the details that will help you identify the item that
was updated. For further details on what actually changed on the item,
the webhook contains the external API URL and the dashboard URL.

* The `external_api_url` found in the JSON can be used by interested
parties to make an additional External API call to the particular item
which will return the most up to date item information.
* The `dashboard_url` found in the JSON can be used to find out what has
changed.  The activity log can be used to see what has been changed and when.

    {
      "item": {
        "pk": 1867,
        "name": "Jet Ski Tour",
        "company": {
          "name": "Hawaiian Adventures",
          "shortname": "hawaiianadventures",
          "currency": "usd"
        },
        "external_api_url": "https://fareharbor.com/api/external/v1/companies/hawaiianadventures/items/1867",
        "dashboard_url": "https://fareharbor.com/hawaiianadventures/dashboard/items/1867/"
      }
    }

Contact <support@fareharbor.com> to have the item webhook turned on for your account.

## Third-party servers

If you do not have your own servers, you can use third-party services
that receive webhooks on your behalf.

## Failing webhooks

If your webhook is functioning normally, it should always return a 200
HTTP status.

Sometimes FareHarbor sends a webhook to your server and there is a
failure of one sort or another. See
[/external-api/faqs-and-best-practices.md#question-500s-and-40x-responses-from-webhooks](/external-api/faqs-and-best-practices.md#question-500s-and-40x-responses-from-webhooks)
for a discussion of why this might happen and how you can fix it.

If FareHarbor detects too many failures (non-200 statuses) within a
short period of time, we may deactivate the webhook and contact you.

Ultimately, it is your responsibility to make sure that the webhook
is working.
